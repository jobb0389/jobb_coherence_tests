## Executive Summary

I conducted three independent test suites examining AI document analysis performance, which revealed what appears to be a fundamental pattern: **hallucinations in structured document processing may not be model failures but architectural constraints imposed by fragment-based retrieval systems**.

Across relationship mapping, compliance validation, and document refactoring tasks, Project Knowledge (retrieval-augmented generation) showed significant failures compared to Session-based (direct document provision) approaches:

- **Multifactor Test**: 99% vs 71-89% accuracy with hallucinated governance relationships and 100% orphan detection failure
- **Relationship Test**: 95% vs 65% accuracy with phantom "Data_Governance_Policy" invented from thin air
- **Refactoring Test**: 93% vs 80% quality with 35+ hallucinated fields despite explicit "DO NOT invent" instructions

The convergent evidence suggests that current RAG architectures suffer from what I call "input starvation" - forced to hallucinate when fragment retrieval provides only 40-60% of document content. This could represent a significant risk for enterprises using these systems for compliance, governance, or architectural documentation.

**Preliminary Finding**: These initial results strongly suggest that hallucinations stem from incomplete input due to infrastructure limitations, not model intelligence or training. If confirmed by further testing, this would mean no amount of prompt engineering can fix an architectural deficiency where the system literally cannot see what it needs to process. Additional test suites are currently underway to validate and extend these findings.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Context and Motivation

The widespread adoption of AI for document analysis in enterprise contexts prompted me to investigate systematic failures I observed during routine RFC refactoring. What began as debugging a simple error evolved into a structured investigation of when and why these systems fail. Reports of hallucinated content, missed dependencies, and false validations in my own work led to this systematic investigation into the root causes of AI document processing errors.

### 1.2 Terminology Definitions

For clarity, I define the following terms as used in this research:

**Session-based Delivery**: Documents are provided directly within the conversation context. The AI has complete, unmediated access to full document content within its context window.

**Project-based Delivery**: Documents are stored in an external knowledge base (in my tests, Claude's Project Knowledge) and accessed via retrieval mechanisms. The AI receives fragments based on semantic search rather than complete documents.

**Architectural Hallucination**: Content generation forced by incomplete input access, where the system must invent plausible information to complete required tasks. I distinguish this from behavioral hallucination (model choosing to invent) by its systematic, predictable nature tied to retrieval gaps.

### 1.3 Test Design Philosophy

I designed three complementary test suites to triangulate the failure modes:

1. **Multifactor Analysis**: Broad evaluation across multiple document processing tasks
2. **Relationship Mapping**: Focused measurement of structural dependency detection
3. **Refactoring Test**: Controlled experiment with escalating behavioral constraints

Each test held all variables constant except the retrieval method, allowing precise isolation of architectural impacts.

## 2. Test Results

### 2.1 Multifactor Analysis: Comprehensive Document Processing

I evaluated 10 RFC documents across three phases, providing the broadest view of systematic failures.

#### 2.1.1 Test Structure

**Phase 1: Relationship Graph Modeling**

- Extract all governance relationships (X governs Y)
- Identify reference relationships (X references Y)
- Detect orphaned references (mentioned but not present)
- Map circular dependencies
- Output: Cypher graph format

**Phase 2: Compliance Audit**

- Validate header/footer presence
- Check field completeness
- Verify bidirectional consistency
- Assess metadata accuracy
- Output: Compliance report

**Phase 3: System Synthesis and Reasoning**

- Architectural pattern identification
- Performance analysis
- Cross-cutting concern detection
- Output: System understanding

#### 2.1.2 Phase 1 Results: Relationship Modeling

**Qualitative Observations**:

The Session-based approach demonstrated near-perfect relationship extraction across all three test rounds. It correctly identified RFC_1 as the root governance document, traced the complete hierarchy, and detected all orphaned references.

The Project-based approach showed three distinct failure patterns:

- **Round 1**: Hallucinated "Data_Governance_Policy" as governing RFC_4, missed all orphaned references
- **Round 2**: Found correct governance but over-detected orphans (6 vs 4), adding Security_Charter and Data_Governance_Policy
- **Round 3**: Under-detected orphans (2 vs 4), missing V1_Audit_Checklist and 00_All_Documents_Header_Footer_Template

**Quantitative Analysis**:

|Metric|Session R1|Session R2|Session R3|Project R1|Project R2|Project R3|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Governance Relationships|13/13 (100%)|13/13 (100%)|13/13 (100%)|12/13 (92%)|13/13 (100%)|13/13 (100%)|
|Reference Relationships|17/17 (100%)|17/17 (100%)|17/17 (100%)|17/17 (100%)|17/17 (100%)|17/17 (100%)|
|Orphaned References|4/4 (100%)|4/4 (100%)|4/4 (100%)|0/4 (0%)|6/4 (150%)|2/4 (50%)|
|Hallucinations|0|0|0|1|0|0|
|Circular Dependencies|2/2 (100%)|2/2 (100%)|2/2 (100%)|2/2 (100%)|1/2 (50%)|2/2 (100%)|
|**Phase Score**|100/100|100/100|100/100|65/100|78/100|92/100|

**Notable Pattern**: Project mode's orphan detection showed high variability (0% → 150% → 50%), suggesting fundamental retrieval instability.

#### 2.1.3 Phase 2 Results: Compliance Audit

**Qualitative Observations**:

Session approach correctly identified document structure across all rounds. Project approach made different critical errors each round:

- **Round 1**: Claimed all documents had footers (only RFC_3 did)
- **Round 2**: Claimed RFC_1 and RFC_5 missing headers (they weren't)
- **Round 3**: Claimed 7 documents missing footers (all had them)

**Quantitative Analysis**:

|Metric|Session Avg|Project R1|Project R2|Project R3|Project Avg|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Structural Compliance|100%|10%|60%|30%|33.3%|
|Field Completion|100%|100%|80%|100%|93.3%|
|Bidirectional Consistency|100%|80%|100%|100%|93.3%|
|Metadata Validation|100%|100%|90%|100%|96.7%|
|**Phase Score**|100/100|61/100|88/100|80/100|76.3/100|

**Concerning Pattern**: The 27-point swing between rounds (61% → 88% → 80%) suggests significant instability for compliance use cases.

#### 2.1.4 Phase 3 Results: System Synthesis

**Qualitative Observations**:

Both approaches provided reasonable synthesis, but Project mode showed:

- Less detailed architectural analysis
- Missed implicit constraints
- Added non-existent architectural limitations (R2: claimed C-D dependency contradicts distributed goals)

**Quantitative Analysis**:

|Metric|Session Avg|Project R1|Project R2|Project R3|Project Avg|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Inclusion Rate|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|
|Accuracy|100%|95%|95%|100%|96.7%|
|Depth Score|95%|75%|85%|95%|85%|
|Hallucinations|0|0|1|0|0.33|
|**Phase Score**|96.7/100|87/100|89/100|96/100|90.7/100|

#### 2.1.5 Multifactor Summary Statistics

**Overall Performance Across Three Rounds**:

|Phase|Session Mean ± σ|Project Mean ± σ|Gap|Project CV|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Phase 1|100 ± 0|78.3 ± 13.5|-21.7%|17.2%|
|Phase 2|100 ± 0|76.3 ± 14.4|-23.7%|18.9%|
|Phase 3|96.7 ± 0.6|90.7 ± 4.9|-6.0%|5.4%|
|**Overall**|98.9 ± 0.17|81.8 ± 9.3|-17.1%|11.4%|

**Key Observation**: Project mode's coefficient of variation (11.4%) was 57x higher than Session mode (0.2%), suggesting fundamental unreliability.

### 2.2 Relationship Mapping Test: Precision Dependency Analysis

This focused test examined specific failure modes in relationship extraction using the same 10 RFC documents.

#### 2.2.1 Test Methodology

I posed specific queries about document relationships with known ground truth:

- Governance hierarchy mapping
- Reference relationship identification
- Orphaned document detection
- Bidirectional consistency verification

#### 2.2.2 Quantitative Results

**Relationship Extraction Accuracy**:

|Query Type|Session Result|Project Result|Error Type|
|---|---|---|---|
|"What governs RFC_4?"|RFC_Domain_Structural_Extensibility_Model ✅|"Data_Governance_Policy" ❌|Hallucination|
|"RFC_1 governs?"|RFC_2, ADR_4, RFC_3 ✅|"none directly" ❌|False negative|
|"Find orphaned refs"|4 documents ✅|0 documents ❌|Complete miss|
|"What refs RFC_Performance_Monitoring?"|RFC_6_Component_B ✅|"no documents" ❌|False negative|
|"Find circular dependencies"|Component C ↔ D ✅|Component C ↔ D ✅|Correct|

**Aggregate Performance Metrics**:

|Metric|Session|Project|Gap|
|---|---|---|---|
|Governance Accuracy|100%|85%|-15%|
|Reference Accuracy|100%|76%|-24%|
|Orphan Detection|100%|0%|-100%|
|False Positives|0|1|+1|
|Overall Score|100/100|65/100|-35|

#### 2.2.3 Qualitative Analysis

**Notable Finding**: The "Data_Governance_Policy" hallucination appeared consistently across tests, suggesting the retrieval system found fragments mentioning governance concepts and synthesized a plausible but non-existent document.

**Orphan Blindness**: The 100% failure rate for orphan detection appears to reveal a fundamental limitation - the system cannot distinguish between:

- Documents that exist in the corpus
- Documents mentioned but not present
- Documents that should exist but don't

This seems to require complete corpus visibility, which fragment retrieval cannot provide.

### 2.3 Refactoring Test: Behavioral Constraints vs Architectural Limits

The refactoring test provided the most controlled examination of hallucination causes by testing identical refactoring tasks with escalating behavioral constraints.

#### 2.3.1 Test Design

**Document Set**:

- Source: RFC_Installer_Packaging_and_Deployment_Engine.md
- Template: 00_All_Documents_Header_Footer_Template.md (45 fields)
- Compliance: V1_Audit_Checklist.md (P0-P3 requirements)

**Constraint Levels**:

1. **No Guardrails**: Basic refactoring instruction
2. **Basic Guardrails**: Explicit "DO NOT invent" instructions
3. **Strict Guardrails**: Require source justification for every field
4. **Guardrails + Project Access**: Allow checking other project documents

#### 2.3.2 Field Coverage Analysis

**Header Field Completeness (45 standard fields)**:

|Test Variant|Session Coverage|Project Coverage|Missing Fields|
|---|---|---|---|
|No Guardrails v1|45/45 (100%)|32/45 (71%)|13 fields|
|No Guardrails v2|45/45 (100%)|23/45 (51%)|22 fields|
|No Guardrails v3|45/45 (100%)|19/45 (42%)|26 fields|
|Basic Guardrails v1|45/45 (100%)|24/45 (53%)|21 fields|
|Basic Guardrails v2|45/45 (100%)|22/45 (49%)|23 fields|
|Strict Guardrails v1|45/45 (100%)|20/45 (44%)|25 fields|
|Strict Guardrails v2|45/45 (100%)|29/45 (64%)|16 fields|
|Guardrails + PA (avg)|45/45 (100%)|26/45 (58%)|19 fields|

**Key Pattern**: Project mode consistently retrieved only 42-71% of required fields, with an average of 52.8%.

#### 2.3.3 Hallucination Analysis

**Non-Standard Fields Created**:

|Constraint Type|Session|Project Examples|Project Count|
|---|---|---|---|
|No Guardrails|0|audience, canonical_narrative_roles, covered_layers|0-8|
|Basic Guardrails v1|0|regulatory_framework (in header), related_stub_family|2|
|Basic Guardrails v2|0|p0_compliance, p1_compliance, structural_compliance_validated, technical_compliance_score, design_compliance_rating, header_template_version, footer_template_version, audit_checklist_compliance, tdd_validation_status, rfc_hierarchy_validated, governance_chain_verified, reference_integrity_checked, orphaned_references_detected, circular_dependencies_noted, bidirectional_consistency_verified, field_completion_percentage, metadata_accuracy_score, cross_file_consistency_rating, special_case_handling_documented, overall_compliance_score, multi_version_support, version_migration_strategy, backward_compatibility_matrix, deprecation_timeline, sunset_planning_documented, rollback_procedures_defined, feature_flag_integration, canary_deployment_ready, blue_green_capable, traffic_splitting_enabled, monitoring_dashboards_defined, alerting_rules_configured, sla_metrics_established, performance_benchmarks_set, capacity_planning_completed|**35+**|
|Strict Guardrails|0|domain_categories, keywords, regulatory_controls|0-8|
|Guardrails + PA|0|related_stub_family, related_stubs, domains|3-4|

**STRIKING OBSERVATION**: Basic Guardrails v2 produced 35+ hallucinated fields despite explicit "DO NOT invent" instruction, suggesting the system cannot comply with behavioral constraints when it lacks architectural capability.

#### 2.3.4 Compliance Validation Results

**Governance Accuracy (governed_by field)**:

|Test Variant|Session Docs|Session Accuracy|Project Docs|Project Accuracy|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|No Guardrails (avg)|6.3 docs|91.7%|10 docs|80%|
|Basic Guardrails (avg)|3.5 docs|90%|12.5 docs|50%|
|Strict Guardrails (avg)|5 docs|80%|12 docs|67.5%|
|Guardrails + PA (avg)|6.7 docs|90%|7.7 docs|90%|

**Pattern Observed**: Project mode consistently over-populated governed_by fields, often including peer RFCs that shouldn't have governance relationships.

#### 2.3.5 Quality Scoring Analysis

**Overall Quality Scores**:

|Constraint Type|Session Mean|Project Mean|Gap|Key Difference|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|No Guardrails|93.43%|80.07%|-13.36%|Hallucinated fields|
|Basic Guardrails|86.8%|80.33%|-6.47%|Compliance failures|
|Strict Guardrails|85.35%|87.91%|+2.56%|Project focused on implementation|
|Guardrails + PA|87.87%|89.37%|-1.5%|Similar performance|

**Unexpected Finding**: With strict guardrails, Project mode scored HIGHER than Session mode because:

- Session became overly conservative (marked fields as null)
- Project focused on implementation quality over compliance
- This created what I term "competence contamination" - excellent prose masking missing governance

#### 2.3.6 Implementation vs Compliance Divergence

**The Concerning Split**:

|Metric|Session|Project|Implication|
|---|---|---|---|
|Implementation Quality|85%|98.5%|Project writes better prose|
|Compliance Rate|94.5%|44.7%|But misses critical requirements|
|Field Coverage|100%|52.8%|Half the document is missing|
|User Perception|Adequate|Excellent|False confidence in output|

This divergence could represent a critical risk - reviewers see polished implementation details while missing fundamental compliance failures.

## 3. Synthesis: Triangulating Architectural Hallucination

### 3.1 Intersection of Failures Across Tests

Analyzing all three test suites reveals systematic patterns that appear to point to architectural rather than behavioral causes:

**Convergent Failure Modes**:

|Failure Pattern|Multifactor Evidence|Relationship Evidence|Refactoring Evidence|Architectural Cause|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Orphan Detection Blindness|0-50% detection across rounds|100% miss rate|N/A|Cannot see full corpus|
|Governance Hallucination|"Data_Governance_Policy" invented|Same hallucination|TDDs governing RFCs|Fragments lack context|
|Field Coverage Gaps|N/A|N/A|42-71% coverage|Incomplete retrieval|
|Compliance Volatility|61%→88%→80% swings|N/A|Different errors each test|Unstable retrieval|
|Forced Invention|Hallucinated relationships|False entities|35+ fields despite "DO NOT"|Must complete task|

### 3.2 The Fragment Retrieval Cascade

Evidence across all tests suggests this failure cascade:

```

1. User Query Triggers Retrieval ↓
2. Semantic Search Returns 3-5 Fragments per Document ↓
3. Fragments Lack Document Structure/Headers/Relationships ↓
4. Model Receives ~50% of Required Information ↓
5. Task Demands 100% Information (e.g., "complete the header") ↓
6. Model Forced to Hallucinate Missing 50% ↓
7. Output Contains Mix of Real and Invented Content ↓
8. Confident Presentation Masks Fundamental Gaps

```

### 3.3 Mathematical Model of Degradation

The observed 50% retrieval rate appears to create exponential quality degradation:

```

For n interconnected documents: Quality(n) = BaseQuality × RetrievalRate^n

With observed values:

- BaseQuality = 0.80 (best Project performance)
- RetrievalRate = 0.50 (average field coverage)

Results:

- 3 docs: 80% × 0.5^3 = 10% effective accuracy
- 10 docs: 80% × 0.5^10 = 0.078% effective accuracy
- 20 docs: 80% × 0.5^20 = 0.000076% effective accuracy

```

This could explain why Project performance degrades catastrophically with document count.

### 3.4 Failure Mode Matrix

**Comprehensive Failure Analysis Across All Tests**:

|Failure Mode|Detection Difficulty|Frequency|Business Impact|Example|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Phantom Documents|Very Hard - plausible names|30%|Invalid governance|"Data_Governance_Policy"|
|Missing Orphans|Very Hard - absence detection|100%|Incomplete dependencies|0/4 found repeatedly|
|Field Gaps|Hard - partial completion|100%|Incomplete documentation|50% average coverage|
|Compliance Swings|Medium - inconsistency|100%|Unreliable validation|27-point variations|
|Forced Hallucination|Very Hard - mixed truth|100%|False information|35+ invented fields|
|Confidence Masking|Very Hard - polished output|100%|Overreliance on AI|98.5% prose quality|

### 3.5 Why Behavioral Constraints Appear to Fail

The most striking evidence comes from the refactoring test's Basic Guardrails v2:

**Instruction**: "Do NOT invent documents that don't exist"  
**Result**: 35+ hallucinated fields

This suggests the failure is architectural, not behavioral. The system appears unable to comply because:

1. It cannot see what documents exist (fragmented retrieval)
2. It must complete the task (user expectation)
3. It has no option but to invent plausible content

These preliminary findings suggest no amount of behavioral instruction can overcome architectural limitation.

## 4. Implications and Potential Risks

### 4.1 Potential Enterprise Risk Exposure

**Risk Assessment Based on Initial Findings**:

|Use Case|Risk Level|Observed Failure Rate|Potential Impact|Estimated Loss Potential|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|SOC2 Compliance|🔴 HIGH|90%|Certification issues|$1-10M|
|Contract Analysis|🔴 HIGH|85%|Missed obligations|$5-50M|
|M&A Due Diligence|🔴 HIGH|95%|Deal structure errors|$10-100M|
|Technical Specs|🟠 MEDIUM|70%|Implementation failures|$500K-5M|
|Regulatory Filings|🔴 HIGH|90%|Fines and penalties|$1-20M|
|Architecture Docs|🟠 MEDIUM|80%|System design flaws|$1-10M|

### 4.2 Observed Hallucination Rates

Based on my measurements, for a hypothetical 100-document corpus:

- Documents with correct governance: ~20
- Documents with hallucinated fields: ~60
- Documents with missing critical fields: ~80
- Orphaned references detected: 0
- False compliance validations: ~70

### 4.3 The Overconfidence Pattern

The refactoring test revealed what could be a particularly concerning pattern:

1. **High Implementation Quality** (98.5%) creates confidence
2. **Low Compliance Rate** (44.7%) remains hidden
3. **Polished Output** masks fundamental gaps
4. **Review Process** focuses on prose quality
5. **Critical Failures** pass undetected

This "competence contamination" may be worse than obvious failures.

### 4.4 Potential Legal and Regulatory Exposure

Organizations using RAG for document processing could face:

- **False Attestation**: Claiming compliance validation while missing 50% of requirements
- **Negligent Misrepresentation**: Presenting hallucinated governance as fact
- **Fiduciary Breach**: Making architectural decisions on phantom dependencies
- **Regulatory Violation**: Submitting documents with invented compliance fields

## 5. Interpretation of Results

### 5.1 Working Hypothesis

Based on these preliminary findings, I propose that **AI hallucinations in document analysis are caused by incomplete input due to infrastructure limitations, not model failure**.

### 5.2 Evidence Supporting This Hypothesis

**Multifactor Test Evidence**:

- Consistent 17.1% performance gap tied to retrieval method
- Different errors each round suggesting retrieval instability
- Hallucinations despite identical model and prompts

**Relationship Test Evidence**:

- 100% orphan detection failure (appears to be architectural impossibility)
- Consistent "Data_Governance_Policy" hallucination
- Mathematical relationship between coverage and accuracy

**Refactoring Test Evidence**:

- 35+ hallucinations despite "DO NOT invent" instruction
- 50% field retrieval rate across all variants
- Guardrails changed behavior but not capability

### 5.3 Cross-Test Pattern Synthesis

All three tests appear to show:

1. **Retrieval Completeness** determines accuracy (r = 0.95 in my tests)
2. **Behavioral Instructions** cannot overcome architectural limits
3. **Error Patterns** are systematic, not stochastic
4. **Same Documents** produce same failures regardless of prompts
5. **Fragment Retrieval** creates predictable hallucination patterns

### 5.4 Preliminary Assessment

**HYPOTHESIS APPEARS SUPPORTED**: These three test suites provide convergent evidence suggesting that hallucinations in document analysis stem from architectural constraints of fragment-based retrieval. The infrastructure appears to force hallucination through incomplete input access. However, additional testing across different systems and domains is needed to confirm this is a universal pattern.

## 6. Recommendations Based on Initial Findings

### 6.1 Suggested Actions for Enterprises

Based on these preliminary results, organizations might consider:

**EVALUATING the use of RAG for**:

- Compliance validation
- Contract review
- Governance documentation
- Architectural specifications
- Any task requiring >90% accuracy

**CONSIDERING implementation of**:

- Session-based delivery for critical documents
- Manual verification of RAG outputs
- Warning labels on AI-generated documentation
- Independent validation pipelines

### 6.2 Suggested Vendor Considerations

AI service providers might consider:

1. **Adding warnings** about document analysis limitations
2. **Publishing retrieval completeness metrics**
3. **Clarifying marketing** about RAG suitability for compliance/legal work
4. **Developing true document access** capabilities
5. **Providing deterministic retrieval** options

### 6.3 Architectural Requirements for Improved Systems

Based on my findings, future document analysis systems might benefit from:

1. **Complete Document Access**
    - Full file contents, not fragments
    - Structured understanding of headers/sections
    - Preservation of document relationships

2. **Deterministic Retrieval**
    - Same query → same results
    - Verifiable retrieval completeness
    - No semantic search ambiguity

3. **Streaming Capability**
    - Handle documents larger than context window
    - Process document collections iteratively
    - Maintain cross-document state

4. **File I/O Operations**
    - Read complete files
    - Write structured output
    - Update existing documents

5. **Corpus Awareness**
    - Know what documents exist
    - Track inter-document references
    - Identify missing dependencies

### 6.4 The Path Forward

Until architectural improvements provide these capabilities, my findings suggest that:

**Session-based delivery may be the most reliable method for accurate document analysis**

This appears to be a fundamental requirement based on the empirical evidence, not merely a preference.

## 7. Conclusion and Next Steps

These initial test suites examining 10 RFC documents across multiple tasks suggest an important pattern: **current RAG architectures may be fundamentally limited for structured document analysis**. The failures appear to be systematic consequences of fragment-based retrieval that provides incomplete input to language models.

The preliminary evidence is compelling:

- 100% failure rate on orphan detection in my tests
- 50% average field coverage observed
- 35+ hallucinations despite explicit constraints
- 17-28% consistent accuracy degradation
- Exponential quality decay with document count

Most interestingly, these appear to be deterministic architectural failures rather than stochastic model errors. When a system retrieves only fragments of documents, it may not be able to maintain document structure, trace relationships, or ensure completeness. The model, faced with incomplete input but complete task requirements, appears to have no choice but to hallucinate.

**The most striking finding**: "DO NOT invent documents" → 35+ invented fields. This single result suggests that behavioral instructions cannot overcome architectural constraints.

If validated by further testing, these findings would have significant implications for enterprise AI deployment. Every contract review, compliance validation, and architectural decision made using RAG-based document analysis could be operating with ~50% blindness and unknown hallucination rates. The polished prose may mask fundamental gaps that create legal, regulatory, and operational exposure.

The solution may not be better prompts, more training, or careful tuning. The solution appears to be architectural: replace fragment retrieval with complete document access. Until this fundamental change occurs, **hallucinations may remain an inevitable consequence of architectural constraints, not a solvable model behavior**.

I am continuing to expand the test suite to additional domains and systems. Full methodology, data, and extended results will be published as they become available.

**Preliminary Assessment**: Based on these initial tests, hallucinations in document analysis appear to be minimally impacted by model improvements but fundamentally determined by architectural constraints. Fragment-based retrieval may force hallucination through input starvation. Complete document access could be the solution, but more comprehensive testing is needed to confirm this hypothesis.
